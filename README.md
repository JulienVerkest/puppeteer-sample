* [Run Puppeteer Tests In Gitpod](#run-puppeteer-tests-in-gitpod)

## Pre-requisites

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Puppeteer repository on your system.

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. In order to run your Puppeteer tests, you will need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. Click the **Access Key** button at the top-right of the Automation Dashboard to access it.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

## Running Your First Puppeteer Test

>**Test Scenario**: The below test script runs on Chrome browser running Windows 10. It visits the LambdaTest platform, clicks on the Pricing page, and navigates to the Automation Testing page.

Once you are done with the steps 1, 2, and 3, you can initiate your first Puppeteer test on LambdaTest. 

Check out [navigation.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/puppeteer-sample/blob/main/navigation.js) file to view the sample test script.

Pass the below command to run the test.

```
node navigation.js
```

## View your Puppeteer test results

The LambdaTest Automation Dashboard is where you can see the results of your Puppeteer tests after running them on the LambdaTest platform.

The below screenshot of LambdaTest Automation Dashboard shows the Puppeteer build on the left and the build sessions associated with the selected build on the right.

On clicking the session name of the respective test, you can view the details of Puppeteer test session that you just executed. For example, the below screenshot shows a test execution details of Puppeteer test like Test Name, Test ID, selected configurations, test logs, basic info, input config, and test session video.

## Run Puppeteer Tests In Gitpod

Select the button below to try this demo in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

[<img alt="Run in Gitpod" width="200px" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70570645/169987363-1408c494-4e2a-4f12-8828-c931eac716b0.png" />](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/LambdaTest/puppeteer-sample)

* After the Gitpod session launches, navigate to the terminal and run the following commands to save your [LambdaTest Credentials](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) to Gitpod as environment variables:

```
eval $(gp env -e LT_USERNAME=******)
eval $(gp env -e LT_ACCESS_KEY=******)
  ```

* Click the following link if you're unsure how to [access your LambdaTest credentials.](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/using-environment-variables-for-authentication-credentials/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=puppeteer-sample). Also, if you start a new terminal in Gitpod, you have to run the following command to reset envrionment variables:
```
 eval $(gp env -e)
```
